# Teensy 4.0 / 4.1 usb host passthrough

This is a simplistic initial version of my USB host passthrough device for the teensy. You can plug in a keyboard and mouse into it and let it passthrough the input at exceptionally fast speed so that it is un-noticable. These inputs can then be modified by incomming commands over serial, or by an algorithim in the code if you so choose to add one.
